# Routing

## What is a route?

- A path to a destination
  - traditionally it would be a way to to get to another html page
  - A relationship with what's in the browser url section

## What's different in react?

- We still only have one .html page
- "Pages" in React are components
- They will be rendered based on what's in the url
- We need some additional code to make this work
  - React Router Dom

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```
