# Lad in the pub

1. Create a function that takes 3 parameters (age, country level of drunk) and returns a string or a boolean that says if someone can enter the pub or not (drunk above 3 is too much)

2. Add a script.js file to the provided code and add the following functionality:

-   The function should be triggered on form submit.
-   a message should be rendered under the form "Come in and have a beer" / "You can't have a beer"
-   If the person is allowed to enter the pub, the colour of the bottle and the button background should change to green.
-   If the person is not allowed to enter the pub, the bottle and the message div background should be red.
-   Only one message should be rendered, if there is already a message on the page, it should be removed when the user clicks the button again and a new one should be displayed.
