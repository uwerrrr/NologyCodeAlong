## Challenge: Return the Remainder from Two Numbers

MVP
There is a single operator in JavaScript, capable of providing the remainder of a division operation. Two numbers are passed as parameters. The first parameter divided by the second parameter will have a remainder, possibly zero. Return that value.

```
remainder(1, 3) ➞ 1

remainder(3, 4) ➞ 3

remainder(-9, 45) ➞ -9

remainder(5, 5) ➞ 0
```

```
lessThan100(22, 15) ➞ true
// 22 + 15 = 37

lessThan100(83, 34) ➞ false
// 83 + 34 = 117

lessThan100(3, 77) ➞ true
```
