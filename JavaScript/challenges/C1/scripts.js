/* Challenge: Storing Personal Information
MVP:
Create three variables to store your first name, last name and age.
Assign values to these variables.
Print a string containing all three variables in the console (should look like "Hi, my name is XXX XXX and I am XX years old)*/
const firstName = "Oscar";
const lastName = "Nguyen";
const age = 28;

let greeting = `Hi, my name is ${firstName} ${lastName} and I am ${age} years old.`;

console.log(greeting);

let value = 2;
console.log((value += 2));
